			README file for the symb module
			-------------------------------

This EPICS module contains the vxWorks global variable device support. This
version is for EPICS 3.14.1, although the C source code is probably compatible
with (identical to?) that shipped with 3.13 releases.

Hypertext documentation is installed into the html directory on building.

The following source files are provided (Makefiles not listed):
