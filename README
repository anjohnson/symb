README file for dev/symb directory
----------------------------------

This directory contains all files necessary to build and test a version
of EPICS vxWorks global variable device support which uses the INST_IO
string as the variable name specification rather than deriving the name
from the record name.

In addition to specifying a variable name, a leading "*" operator indicates
that the variable is a pointer and a trailing "[nnnn]" indicates that an
element of an array should be accessed.

Refer to the header comments of devSymbFind.c for full details.
