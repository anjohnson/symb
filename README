			README file for the devSymb module
			----------------------------------

This EPICS module contains the vxWorks global variable device support. This
version is for EPICS 3.14.1, although the C source code is probably compatible
with (identical to?) that shipped with 3.13 releases.

Hypertext documentation is installed into the html directory on building.
